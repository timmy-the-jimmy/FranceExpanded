Blum, being a Jew, has been subject to numerous threats and insults from the right. With the Far Right leagues retaining much influence in France, they have organized antisemitic riots all throughout the nation, some calling for Blum's resignation, and others for his death. Nevertheless, it has caused great instability throughout France, and we must deal with them."

 francepm.9.d:0 "Finland, after several failed attempts by the Soviet Union to breach her sovereignty via diplomatic means has found herself in a war with the Soviets. In France, the war has become a point of contention, with many in the government wishing to see help delivered to the Finns, seeing the Soviet Union as a threat to international peace and stability.

In addition, with the election of the Socialist government, workers, backed by the Parti Communiste Francais have gone on strike, occupying many factories across the nation, hoping to extract concessions from their employers, calling for the Government to back them. We have been invited to Matignon for negotiations in order to resolve the Strikes, but the issue of capital flight may take longer to solve. In the end, one thing is certain.

Across the political spectrum, communists, socialists, liberals, and conservatives each propose different solutions to how to resolve the crisis. Of particular notice however, is the tension in the Popular Front regarding the topic. Already, conflict has arisen, with the Radicals aiming to keep France out of the war, while the Communists petition the government to intervene in the conflict to our south. With tensions rising in the Popular Front, we must resolve the issue before it tears the coalition apart."

 #francepm.15.d:0 "The success of the Popular Front to successfully deal with the troubles facing France so far has caused great celebration among many. However, with the invitiation of communist ministers into the government, and increasingly communist policies being passed, the Communists have been able to solidify their control over the Popular Front, an increasingly unpopular move with the Radicals, who have been increasingly alienated from the coalition. With their increasing power over the Popular Front, the Communists have managed to secure it's political popularity through their policies, and now find themselves in the position to cast the centrist Radicals out of the growing leftist coalition, leaving but one question.

 francepm.17.a_1:0 "For a long period now, the right has led France, ever since the riots in 1934 forced the resignation of the resignation of the leftist government. However, the failure of Flandin in his postion as Prime Minister to resolve the issues that France has faced has caused much disillusionment with the National Bloc amongst the general population. In order then, to save it's position in leading France, a more centrist member, Paul Reynaud of the coalition has been chosen to lead the government."

With such an explosion in popularity, the leaders of the major right wing leagues in France have organized a March on Paris, their members marching on the same ground on which they protested a few years ago in 1934. With the act resembling Mussolini's earlier March on Rome, some have cricitized the right for their totalitarian nature, but the backlash appears to be limited, with many fearing for their lives."

 francepm.19.d:0 "With the Far Right continually influencing the policies of the sitting government in Paris, of which has failed to deal with the many issues France has, many have taken to the streets, rioting against the actions of the right, calling for the government to resign and a more moderate government to take power. With no such action being undertaken, further protests have taken place and street violence has occured between the rioters and the paramilitaries of the Far Right Leagues, eventually ending with the breaking of the protests and the arrests of several prominent leftists. Despite our success, such an action has significantly destabilized our regime."

 francepm.20.t:0 "The National Bloc Succeeds"
 francepm.20.d:0 "The National Bloc, through somewhat democratic means has managed to resolve the important issues facing France.

 fpmmilplot.1.d:0 "The Far-Right Leagues, ever a thorn in our side have mobilized in response to the increasing communist influence over our government. Not wishing to see France fall to Bolshevism, they have begun paramilitary actions and escalated the political violence already terrorizing our society.

 fpmmilplot.3.d:0 "With the conflict between left and right tearing apart the nation, the ordinary person finds themselves torn between two sides.

The capitalists, who have always hated our movement but been reluctant to support political violence have shown their true colors and allied with the far-right in the hopes of preventing a socialist revolution in France. The far-right, now strengthened by the vast wealth of the bourgeoise find themselves in a much better position to oppose us."

Despite their protests, we will continue directing France into the future, and no liberal can stop us."

 fpmnewrev.1.t:0 "A New Constitution"
 fpmnewrev.1.d:0 "As France enters a new emancipated age, we require a new constitution so that we are not chained to the restrictions of the old. To achieve this task, a Constitutional Convention to write a new constitution has been formed. The new constitution, while not explicitly socialist in order to assuage moderates, it includes several guarantees of the rights of the working class. Within the Convention, a lively debate has been happening concerning the strength of the presidency. \n\nOn one side lies René Nicod, a new and upcoming socialist politician who leads the Union populaire française, a new and growing political party which has seperated from the larger communist party on issues of foreign policy. While not as popular with the left, he still has many supporters among them as well as much support of those in the center who favor his more moderate views. His proposal would ensure the dominance of the French parliament over the presidency, a quite popular policy among those who fear a communist presidency. \n\nOn the other side lies those more radical individuals led by Maurice Thorez, current Prime Minister and leader of the Communist Party. Well entrenched in political society these days, he has the support among many among the left. His proposal for the presidency would make it much stronger, able to act more independent of parliament, claiming that the recent political turmoil and political gridlock in France would not have happened if the presidency had been stronger. \n\nWhoever wins will gain much political clout in french society and will no doubt end up as the leader of France in the near future, as elections are to be called immediately after the constitution is ratified."

Some of them have the confidence to fight us in the streets but there has always been a contingent who have sought to strike down the people's will in less visible ways. Fighting against our moves at every step, the the leaders of the political opposition, cowards that they are, have been successful in preventing us from enacting the will of the people by colluding with lower level bureaucrats and constantly stalling our political agendas in the parliament. We will suffer their abuses no longer. \n\nMobilizing those most dedicated to the Revolution, we have assembled the Groupes de défense antifascistes to act revolutionary guard to be led by fellow Communist Jacques Duclos in order finally purge the rot from our society. At midnight tonight they are poised to execute their plan to purge France of her class enemies and bring France into a new, more egalitarian age. \n\nThe plan looks set to go ahead, however Duclos has asked for permission to expand the GDA into into a larger Communist paramilitary organization in order to protect the new French Revolution from what he sees as a continent full of reactionaries. There are some concerns that this may give him too much power but he has asssured the party that they have nothing to worry."

Traditionally, the Communist Party has been in favor of expanding women's rights and granting them suffrage, but with the party joining the Popular Front, it no longer must only please it's own members but also those more moderate members of the coalition. Some argue that the Communist Party's role in the coalition gives it leverage to push through women's suffrage but others argue that it would not be worth alienating the other members of the coalition and radicalizing the right. We must choose a path."
