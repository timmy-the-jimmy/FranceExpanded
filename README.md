The sequel to my previous mod regarding French Prime Ministers, French Politics Expanded serves as a touch up for French content in Vanilla Hoi4, adding new events, ideas, and decisions to France. Who you elect in the 1936 elections determines the future of France.

The Communists
Electing the Popular Front in 1936 and Embracing the Strike Wave, rather than making concessions will allow you to go down the Communist Path. Accelerate the revolution at the cost of risking a military coup, or take things slow and steady. Once you've become communist, you could either side with world democracies or the Soviet Union against fascism, or go it alone with the goal of World Revolution and forming the European Commune.

The Socialists
Electing the Popular Front in 1936 will lead you down the historical path. Facing internal turmoil, you must resolve the issues of the French Economy, Spanish Civil War. Succeding leads to Blum's government remaining and the Popular Front staying intact, providing many buffs, but should you fail, as France did historically, the Popular Front will stagnate eventually die under Camille Chautemps.

The Liberals
The choices you make determine who leads France by the end of the political crisis. Failing as the Popular Front leads to Edouard Daladier becoming Prime Minister, with Paul Reynaud potentially appearing later if France intervenes in the Winter War or suffers defeats to a foreign power. Paul Reynaud may additionally come into power should the National Bloc fail.

The Conservatives
Electing the National Bloc in 1936 will lead Pierre Laval or Pierre-Etienne Flandin becoming leader of France, depending on how you respond to the crisis in Ethuopia. The National Bloc must ensure Communism is defeated in France, fix the French Economy and commit to non-intervention in Spain to assure success. Should you fail, Paul Reynaud will become Prime Minister early. Succeeding as the National Bloc may be easier and quicker, but it may pay off less.

Foreign Policy
Each political faction in France has their own Foreign Policy, based on real-world policies. The left may form the Little Entente, The center can follow historical path of joining the British and the allies. Finally, the right can put France first, forming the Stresa Front and siding with Italy, the very same thing that forced them to resign in real life.


Future Additions?
Don't count this as a promise, but I do want to add more to this mod. Add stuff to Vichy and Free France, as well as the other ahistorical paths. We'll see if it happens.
